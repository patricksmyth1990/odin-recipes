1.0 -- Introduction
An HTML-based recipe book.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated that I know how to use basic HTML.

2.0 -- End of Project Reflection
This simple project allowed me to demonstrate that I know how to set up HTML documents with the boilerplate, use heading, <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <img>, and <a> tags, and how to link to other webpages and images using relative links.
